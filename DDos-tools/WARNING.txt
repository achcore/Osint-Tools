                  WARNING! 
 

<\-----------------------------------------/>
 

A DDoS attack is an action by attackers
 

aimed at disrupting the functionality
 

of a company's infrastructure and
 

customer services. Attackers artificially
 

create an avalanche-like growth of requests
 

to an online resource in order to increase
 

its load and disable it.
 

Sometimes the sentence for a cyber attack
 

can reach decades, don't do anything stupid!
